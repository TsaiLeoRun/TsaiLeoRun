# Welcome to my Github page.

Hi folks 👋

😁 I am currently waiting for my final result of my PhD viva (done on 1st Dec 2020)

🔭 I’m currently working on deep learning theory at Huawei's Noah's Ark Lab

🌱 I’m currently learning competitive programming skills used in IOI/ACM-ICPC to compensate for my regret in my past years

🧮 I'm also interested in IMO problems, the reason why I want to learn them is the same as above

💰 I’m looking at quant jobs in industry because I feel they are trying to solve hard problems every day

💬 Ask me about mathemtaics and competitive programming.

📫 How to reach me: dr.leran.cai@gmail.com (this is a bit cocky 👀)

⚡ Fun fact: My Github profile was first noticed by other people because I wrote some solution notes to Mitzenmacher and Upfal's book. 

Some resolutions in 2021:

- [] Mitzenmacher and Upfal's solution notes.
- [] Leetcode solutions to 500 problems and detailed notes.
- [] Codeforces Master Level
- [] Maths notes: analysis, linear algebra, probability theory, statistics, combinatorics, spectral graph theory
- [] Algorithmic trading practices (to make a lot of money so I can do whatever I want)
- [] Run 10km regularly
