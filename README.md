# Welcome to my Github page.

Hi folks 👋

😁 I am currently correcting my PhD thesis (approved on 19th Jan 2021).

🔭 I’m currently working on deep learning theory at Huawei's Noah's Ark Lab.

🌱 I’m currently learning competitive programming skills used in IOI/ACM-ICPC to compensate for my regret in my past years.

🧮 I'm also interested in IMO problems, the reason why I want to learn them is the same as above.

💰 I’m looking at quant jobs in industry because I feel they are trying to solve hard problems every day.

💬 Ask me about mathemtaics and competitive programming.

📫 How to reach me: dr.leran.cai@gmail.com (this is a bit cocky 👀).

⚡ Fun fact: My Github profile was first noticed by other people because I wrote some solution notes to Mitzenmacher and Upfal's book. 

Some resolutions in 2021:

- [ ] Mitzenmacher and Upfal's solution notes.
- [ ] Leetcode solutions to 500 problems and detailed notes.
- [ ] Codeforces Master Level.
- [ ] Maths notes: analysis, linear algebra, functional analysis, probability theory, statistics, combinatorics.
- [ ] Algorithmic trading practices (to make a lot of money so I can do whatever I want).
- [ ] Run 10km regularly.
